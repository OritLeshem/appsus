APPSUS is an application that was built in less than 72 hours.
by Orit Leshem (Keep)
and Yossi Karasik (Gmail)
each of us was in charge of her/his mini-app, and in the end, we combined it into one app.
the challenge besides writing a react.js app for the first time was to write it together as a team with CSS that can affect both mini-apps
it was fun working together, and we really like the outcome!
